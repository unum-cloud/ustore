 *
 * @brief C bindings for collections of @b Documents.
 * It extends the basic "ukv.h" towards values storing hierarchical documents.
 * Examples: JSONs, MsgPacks, BSONs and a number of other similar formats.
 * Yet no guarantees are provided regarding the internal representation of the
 * values, so if if you want to access same values through binary interface,
 * you may not get the exact same bytes as you have provided in.
 *
 * @section Number of Keys vs Number of Fields
 * One of the biggest questions to API is preferring "Zips" vs the "Cartesian Product"
 * of "Key" and "Field" combinations. When writing we may want to discard a certain
 * subset of fields in every document, but we may also be interested in having a
 * more targetted approach.
 *
 * @section Type Checking and Casting
 * Ideally, the data shouldn't be parsed more than once, to avoid performance loss.
 * So the primary interfaces of Docs Store are type-agnostic. Vectorized "gather"
 * operations perform the best effort to convert into the requested format, but
 * it's not always possible.

 *
 * @param[in] fields
 *              JSON-Pointer paths to scalars in desired documents.
 *              If `fields_stride` is set to zero, we assume that all paths
 *              are concatenated with a NULL-character delimiter.
 *
 * @param[out] columns_validities
 *              Bitset, which will indicate validity of gather objects.
 *              It must contain enough bits to consecutively stores the validity
 *              indicators for every cell in the exported table of scalars.
 *              The layout is:
 *                  * 1st column bitset: `docs_count` bits rounded up to 8 multiple.
 *                  * 2nd column bitset: `docs_count` bits rounded up to 8 multiple.
 *                  * 3rd column bitset: `docs_count` bits rounded up to 8 multiple.
 *              And so on for `fields_count` columns.
 *              Indexing (little-endian vs BIG-endian) is identical to Apache Arrow.
 *              The @param columns_conversions and @param columns_collisions have
 *              same sizes and layouts, but are not supported by Apache Arrow.
 *
 * @param[out] columns_conversions
 *              An @b Optional bitset, which will indicate type conversions.
 *              Conversions mean, that the export/cast changes the semantics.
 *              We identify following type groups: booleans, integers, floats, strings.
 *              Any downcasting conversion between them will be done with best-effort,
 *              but may not be lossless. Meaning that @c `bool` to @c `int` isn't
 *              considered a downcast, same as @c `bool` to @c `double`.
 *
 * @param[out] columns_collisions
 *              An @b Optional bitset, which will indicate key collisions.
 *              Collisions imply, that a key was found, but it's internal
 *              contents can't be converted to the requested scalar type.
 *
 * @param[out] columns_scalars
 *              Buffers for scalars to be exported to.
 *              The ordering of it's element is identical to @param columns_validities,
 *              but every column only needs: `docs_count * sizeof(scalar)`
 *
 * @section Strings Layout
 * Texts will be appended with a null-termination character, binaries - will not.
 * Offsets and lengths will be organized in a @b column-major layout with `docs_count`
 * entries in every column, but the contents of the joined string will be organized
 * in a @b row-major order. It will make the data easier to pass into bulk text-search
 * systems or Language Models training pipelines.
 *
 * @section Apache Arrow
 * We may have used Apache Arrow @c `RecordBatch` directly with @c `ArrowSchema`
 * or @c `ArrowArray`. It, however, would be inconsistent with other UKV APIs.
 * To go from the response of this function to Arrow: @see `ukv/arrow.h`.
 *
 * @section Joins
 * A user may want to join fields stored under different same keys in different collections.
 * That should be implemented as two (or multiple) separate requests for space-efficiency.
